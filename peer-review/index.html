<div class="box"><p class="text">1. On first glance, what would you expect to be able to do with this website?<br>

Portrays the concept of insomnia. Clarity of the narrative through layout.<br><br><br>

2. What is the content of this website?<br>

Based on the play “Sleep no more”. Displays the quotes from the scene of sleepwalking.<br><br><br>

3. Does the form of the website feel intentional? Does it reflect part of the concept?

<br><br>Yes the form feels intentional. The font and the colors give a creepy/eerie vibe that goes with the concept. Also overlaying of the text depicts insomnia.<br><br>

4. Is any information missing?

<br>Not really.<br><br><br>

5. Are any of the design features distracting, out of place, or unnecessary?
<br>
Too much overlaying. Maybe reduce that.
First page font color red isn’t legible.<br><br><br>

6. What kind of formal design principles is the designer utilizing well? What can be improved and how? (Typography, scale, color, composition..)<br>
Maybe experiment with the font. However love the use of serif and background color as well as positioning.<br><br><br>

7. Does the scale of the design feel appropriate to the device?<br>

Yes it is.<br><br><br>

8. What, if anything, would make this easier to use and understand?<br>

Nothing.<br><br><br>
9. What kind of navigation is involved in this prototype? Is it clear? Why or why not.<br>

Scrolling vertically.<br><br><br>

10. How would you imagine a second round of this prototype evolving?<br>

Making a choice of whether you want to go with the circular theme of the general one and finding animation that compliments your project.<br><br><br>

11. What, if anything, would you change about this website so far?<br>

Experimenting with the font.<br><br><br>

12. Do the design decisions feel appropriate for the concept and content of the website? How do you see the two being related right now.<br>

Yes they do. The design creates a mood that adds to the content.<br><br><br>

13. Is this website a memorable execution of this idea? Why or why not? What is most memorable?<br>

The theme is memorable as well as the concept of insomnia.<br><br><br>

14. Any final thoughts or comments?<br>
Looking forward to seeing the final thing with the animation!!<br><br><br>

<br>

1. What did you gather from the peer review? What, if anything, did you adjust in your design?<br><br><br>
2. What, if anything, did you take away from this exercise?<br><br><br>

I gathered that my design is too experimental which makes the distinction between the two languages unclear. I should make a more cohesive layout that stays the same throughout.<br><br><br>

Peer reviews help you understand your work from another perspective which is important for an artist. You can’t necessarily be the best judge of your work by yourself. Two heads are better than one.
